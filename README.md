Oslo Haskell Workshops
======================

## Ideas

* A series of workshops aimed at newcomers
* First part focuses on the Haskell language
* ... followed by explorations of popular libraries, tools and frameworks
* Loosely based on (LYAH)[http://learnyouahaskell.com/]
* Each workshop will consist of shorter lectures followed by assignments

## Packages I'd like to cover

* Fay/Haste/GHCJS or some other compile-to-js tool
* Yesod
* Persistent
* Lenses
* Haxl
