Oslo Haskell Workshops
======================

# Ideas and guiding principles
* A series of workshops aimed at newcomers
* teach the smallest possible subset of features required to be "productive" in Haskell
* ... but with emphasis on best practice right from the start
* Each workshop continues where the last one left of, so no real limits of scope has to be enforced for each session
* Each workshop will consist of shorter lectures followed by assignments
* First part focuses on the Haskell language basics
* ... followed by explorations of popular libraries, tools and frameworks
* Loosely based on [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) and [Brent Yorgey's course](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html)
* [What I Wish I Knew When Learning Haskell](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#intro)
