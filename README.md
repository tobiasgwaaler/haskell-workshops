Oslo Haskell Workshops
======================

## Ideas

* A series of workshops aimed at newcomers
* First part focuses on the Haskell language
* ... followed by explorations of popular libraries, tools and frameworks
* Loosely based on [LYAH](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* Each workshop will consist of shorter lectures followed by assignments

## Packages I'd like to cover
* [Cloud Haskell](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cloud-haskell)
* [Fay](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/fay), [Haste](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haste), [GHCJS](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) or some other compile-to-js tool
* [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com/)
* [Persistent](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent), [Acid-state](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/acid-state)
